PostScript/Simple version 0.06
==============================

PostScript::Simple allows you to have a simple method of writing PostScript
files from Perl. It has several graphics primitives that allow lines, circles,
polygons and boxes to be drawn. Text can be added to the page using standard
PostScript fonts.

Features include:

    Generation of multi-page PostScript files
    Generation of single-page EPS files
    Creating lines/circles etc.
    Rectangles and boxes
    Text
    Colour
    Pre-defined paper sizes
    Etc. etc.

The file examples/example.pl provides some bad examples of what this module
does.

An experimental Subversion repository of PostScript::Simple is now available at
http://svn.newtoncomputing.co.uk/pss. Username is "anonymous" with a blank
password. The latest version can be checked out with the following command:

  svn co http://svn.newtoncomputing.co.uk/pss/trunk simple

This will put the files in a directory named "simple". To take a look at the
next generation version of PostScript::Simple, currently in very slow
development, try:

  svn co http://svn.newtoncomputing.co.uk/pss/branches/nextgen

Which will create the directory "nextgen" for the files to go in.
