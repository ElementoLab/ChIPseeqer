TO-DO

import eps files into the postscript (in progress, core finished)
better error reporting (postscript comments still?)
check landscape: possible problems with rotation
PostScript "compression", i.e. /n {newpath} bind def
code compression using single letter dictionary defs (optional?)
any postscript optimisation that can be done?
hope that units are now correct... check
postscript font support?
define shape functions
translate / scale / rotate functions?
generate PostScript using a stack, rather than writing
  to the end of a text variable? could lead to some rather
  neat stuff (loops etc) (moved to ps:s "next gen")
different line styles (dashes) (easy)
ttf font support? (get lost!)
